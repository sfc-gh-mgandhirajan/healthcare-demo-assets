-- Phase 2 readiness gate for the Pharmacy Cost Command Center accelerator.
-- STRUCTURAL, self-contained PASS/FAIL over the 3 conformance tables. No customer
-- data values are hard-coded. Run before Phase 3 (derived-build). Every row:
--   CHECK_NAME | STATUS ('PASS' | 'FAIL') | DETAIL
-- The gate is deterministic because Phase 1 SEEDS one row per REQUIRED contract
-- element/relationship (IS_REQUIRED=TRUE), so "required coverage" = "no required
-- row left unmapped or un-approved".
-- Parameterized: replace {{TARGET_DATABASE}}.{{TARGET_SCHEMA}} at run time.
